# SMS-Spam-Detection

### Introduction

In this project, I train the model using a probabilistic classification algorithm to detect whether the SMS messages are spam or ham. After training the model is deployed as a service to the users using Flask.

The data is a collection of 5574 SMS messages tagged as spam or ham and is fetched from Kaggle from the link below-

### Concepts Learned
Supervised machine learning algorithm- Naive Bayes Classifier 
* Training the classifier on the SMS dataset
* Used the trained classifier to predict a message as spam or ham
* Deploying a model using Flask

app.py uses this model to build a command line application using the Python microframework, Flask.
